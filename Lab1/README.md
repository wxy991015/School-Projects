Lab 1 - Web Systems review(-ish): HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSON
Thinking Process: 
Step 1. Create JSON file: to output the JSON into a HTML page, the first thing I think about is to create this
big JSON file with more than 200 news in it. I find several sources of RSS and use a free JSON converter
to convrt those RSS files into the JSON file and merge them into a single file.

Step 2. Create JavaScript Function: there needs some JavaScript functions to scrape those items in the JSOn files
and output them in the HTML file. There is a loop method I can use through JavaScript to output HTML. I must
make sure that it works and be able to show at least the title and the short description of those news.

Step 3. Add CSS&jQuery Transition: the homework asks for a transition that shows 5 news a time in 3 seconds and
then make the articles cycle through the ticker. I find "ADD SPECIFIC METHOD HERE" method to allow news to
cycle through the ticker smoothly and be able to keep the time.

Step 4. Add Creatively: finally, I add some styles, colors, margins, and so on, through CSS3, Bootstrap to make the
HTML page look better and more appealing.

Where I got Stuck:
1. Homebrew Installation: In order to use JSON properly, I must create an Apache and make the localhost 
work on my machine. However, XAMPP does not work because I am a Mac user. I have to use Homebrew instead,
but I have never usd Homebrew before.

2. Add Transitions: I am not very familiar with animations of CSS3 or jQuery. As a result, that is something
I have to look up in many resources. I have to learn how to use those transitions to make both the cycle work
and the time works.

Individual Creativity:
Since the lab has already had the animation, I do not add very fanscinating styles to the HTML page. I just
change the background to deepblue and the ticker to be powderblue, make the header font to Permanent Marker 
and Caveat. I use the Boostrap cards to display all the news and add a link that users can go to each websites.
