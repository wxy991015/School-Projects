## Business Problem:
To find the best external innovators and startups that will drive the next generation of science, 
J&J Innovation conducts Company Landscapes in which we try to identify all companies and
assets that apply to a specific area of science. A number of these startups have not yet been analyzed
and indexed by the large data providers (Cortellis, Pitchbook, GlobalData), which leads to an incomplete data set.

## Hypothesis:
By combining the scraping of information from known startups websites and creating auto-generated tags based on indications, 
Key Target-based Actions & Key Technologies, we can create a unique dataset that will allow us to find companies that 
would have otherwise been missed through our internal searches.
